IÂ´ve use HTML for the structure and then just built it up with CSS applying the resources and guidelines provided by Frontmentor.
It was quite nice to do this project because I'm getting into front end to make my way to JavaScript and actually it was one of the only projects that fits my basic knowledge so the pressure was up to my expectations.
I'm looking forward to face the next challenge!

About me:
I'm 45y.o., from Buenos Aires - Argentina.
I'm a graphic designer for about 22 years and UX/UI designer for about one year.
I'm self taughting programing and I'm really enjoing it so I believe I'll build my profile in this branch without any doubt.
